# AGI Cockpit

**Run multiple coding agents in parallel. Keep every task, decision, and result in one cockpit.**

AGI Cockpit is a cross-platform parallel coding agent manager for coordinating Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Grok, and other terminal-based agents. It gives each piece of work a persistent task, lets you supervise multiple agents without mixing their context, and keeps human approvals close to the work.

> This repository contains generated public documentation, screenshots, and release notes. The AGI Cockpit application source code is not included.

## Why AGI Cockpit

- **Parallel coding agent manager** — Run isolated tasks side by side, see which agents are working or waiting, and return to any result without losing context.
- **Multi-agent by design** — Use Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Grok, Antigravity, or a terminal task from the same interface.
- **Human decisions stay explicit** — Agents can send an Ask when they need a choice or confirmation. Review and answer it from the desktop app or mobile PWA.
- **Mobile PWA supervision** — Check progress, answer Asks, send follow-up instructions, and operate Autoruns from another device.
- **Cross-platform** — Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Local working environment** — Agent processes and project files remain on the computer running Cockpit. Each agent or connected service uses its own network and authentication settings.

## One workspace for every agent

AGI Cockpit treats a task as the durable unit of work. A task contains the objective, working directory, selected agent, conversation, approvals, changed files, previews, and result. You can run several tasks at once while keeping their histories and project scope separate.

The desktop app supports Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Grok Build, Antigravity, Cursor, Cockpit Agent, and ordinary terminal commands. Supported agents can run in a native task UI or a full terminal.

## Supervise from mobile

The mobile PWA connects to the Cockpit running on your computer. It is designed for supervision rather than moving your development environment to a hosted service.

All local features are free and unlimited with no account required. An [AGI Labo membership](https://agi-labo.com/en?ref=cockpit-app#pricing) ($20/month or $200/year, with a 7-day free trial) adds exactly two Cockpit features: Autorun and remote access through the PWA.

## Get started

1. [Download AGI Cockpit](https://agi-labo.com/en/tools/cockpit) for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
2. Open the app and select a project workspace or temporary folder.
3. Choose an installed coding agent.
4. Create a task with a clear objective.
5. Review the result, answer any Ask, and send follow-up instructions from the same task.
